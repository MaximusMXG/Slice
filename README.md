# 🍕 Slice: The Indie Streaming Platform

Slice is a streaming platform centered around indie content, combining elements of Netflix, Steam, and GoFundMe. It empowers both creators and viewers by allowing users to directly allocate their subscription or ad revenue to specific creators using a unique "pizza slice" system.

## 🎯 Vision
Our goal is to create a sustainable, user-driven platform for indie filmmakers, web series creators, animators, and game developers. Slice ensures that content creators receive direct support from their audience, eliminating the inefficiencies of traditional revenue distribution models.

## 🔥 Key Features
- **Pizza Slice Funding** – Users allocate their subscription or ad revenue to a max of 5 or 10 creators, depending on their choice.
- **Regional Pricing** – Subscription costs vary by region to improve accessibility while ensuring fair creator compensation.
- **Creator Upload System** – Works similarly to Steam, allowing indie creators to distribute their content seamlessly.
- **Hybrid Platform** – Combines streaming and crowdfunding elements, enabling users to back projects and watch completed works.
- **Community-Driven Support** – Users directly fund the creators they love instead of relying on a flat ad-revenue split.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Sign Up & Subscribe** – Choose a plan that fits your region.
2. **Pick Your Creators** – Allocate your pizza slices to your favorite indie filmmakers, animators, or game developers.
3. **Watch & Support** – Stream content while your chosen creators earn revenue from your subscription and ad views.
4. **Discover & Fund** – Support in-development projects to help bring them to life.
